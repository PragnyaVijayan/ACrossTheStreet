# A-Cross The Street

A-Cross The Street is an app built to help those without insurance realize that healthcare is just across the street. Our purpose is to make medical care accessible to those without insurance. This user focused app marketed to Oakland residents without insurance is a one-stop app whose usage can be organized into two categories. 
1. An outreach resource aimed at increasing access to public insurance. Let's check if you qualify for MediCal. If not, maybe Covered California is the right match?
2. Provide accessible information on which resources are available without insurance. Let's get you connected with some local clinics/hospitals that can offer you care for little to no cost.
